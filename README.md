# Computer-Architecture

Every branch is a unique variant. Each variant belongs to some year. (Example: "2015-01" stands for the first variant of year 2015.)

If the branch already exists, name the branch through adding a minus. (Example: "2015-01-0" stands for alternative first variant of the given year.)

All the needed images or descriptions you should link to Readme.md.

Materials needed in the process of learning you should place under Misc branch.

Master branch contains only readme and all the relevant information about the repository, subject etc.
